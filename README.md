# Flakebot: Agents Building and Deploying Their Own Tools

## Overview

Flakebot is a system designed to improve the development and deployment process of agent tools. The primary objective is to shift tool building and testing from runtime to compile-time using Rust and Nix, ensuring deterministic builds and reducing runtime issues.

### The Problem with Agents

- Unpredictability: Agents often don't reveal what they can or will do until runtime.
- Runtime Issues: Agents are prone to errors and feedback loops due to runtime dependencies and build systems.

### Examples of Common Issues

- Cryptography Libraries and other complex dependencies: Agents attempting to create their own cryptography libraries require dependencies (e.g., OpenSSL) not available in certain environments.
- Interpreter Installation: Agents struggle with Python versioning issues, making self-installation problematic.
- Cross-Platform Execution: Agents trying to execute Windows binaries in a Linux environment face compatibility issues.

### Solution

To address these problems, Flakebot proposes the use of:

- Rust: For building and testing tools at compile-time.
- Nix: For deterministic builds and reliable deployment.

## Big Ideas

### Compile-Time Tool Building:

- Building tools with Rust allows for testing and documenting actions at compile-time rather than runtime.
- Rustâ€™s integrated documentation and testing capabilities are ideal for use with large language models (LLMs) and incremental testing.

### Deterministic Builds with Nix:

- Nix provides hash-based builds, ensuring that API documentation matches the correct commit.
- Nix flakes create reproducible, deterministic executable environments independent of the underlying system.

### Demo

## Future Work

### One-Click Agent Deployment:

- Integrate with Replit for seamless, one-click deployment of agent tools/services using Nix-flake.

### Nix-Flake Tool/Service Deployment:

- Focus on deploying tools/services based on Nix flakes rather than template development environments.

## Key Takeaways

- Agent tools should be written in Rust for compile-time building and testing.
- Deployment should be managed using Nix for deterministic builds and reliable execution.
- By moving tool building to compile-time with Rust and using Nix for deployment, long-running agents can build, deploy, and use their tools as needed efficiently.
